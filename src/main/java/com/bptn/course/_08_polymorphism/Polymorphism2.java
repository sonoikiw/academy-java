//Method overriding
//1. Scenario- it occurs when a sub-class overrides an existing method in the parent class
//2. Name of the method, return type of the method and number of parameters should exactly match
//3. By convention overridden methods contains @Override annotation above the method signature
//4. Methods with final keyword in the parent class cannot be overridden
//5. Static method in the parent class cannot be overridden
//6. Also known as run-time polymorphism
//7. It needs inheritance to support method overriding
